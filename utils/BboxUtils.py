    '''
        Simple function to calculate the center point of a given detection. This can be useful for both 
        annotation and tracking purposes. 

        Parameters:
            * bbox : dict -> the detections metadata to calculate the center point. 

        Returns: 
            * center_x, center_y : tuple -> two floating point values representing the detections center 
                on the x and y axis.

def measure_euclidean_distance(p1, p2):

    '''
        Function to measure the straight-line distance between two points. Gets the sqaure values of the inputs and sqaures the output
            to help reduce computation. 

        Paramaters:
            * p1 : tuple -> (x1, y1), detection start position.
            * p2 : tuple -> (x2,y2), detection end position.

        Returns:
            * euclidean_distance : float -> distance between one position and another.
